# [399. Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [a_i, b_i]` represents a road from city `a_i` to city `b_i`.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city `0`), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city `0`. Return the **minimum**  number of edges changed.

It's **guaranteed**  that each city can reach city `0` after reorder.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/13/sample_1_1819.png" style="width: 311px; height: 189px;">
> Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]

 > Output: 3

 > Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).

**Example 2:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/13/sample_2_1819.png" style="width: 509px; height: 79px;">
> Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]

 > Output: 2

 > Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).

**Example 3:** 

> Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]

 > Output: 0

**Constraints:** 

- `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `connections.length == n - 1`
- `connections[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i <= n - 1`
- `a_i != b_i`
