# [547. Number of Provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

Given a binary tree `root`, a node X in the tree is named**good**  if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of **good**  nodes in the binary tree.

**Example 1:** 

**<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_1.png" style="width: 263px; height: 156px;">** 

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are **good** .
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
```
**Example 2:** 

**<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_2.png" style="width: 157px; height: 161px;">** 

```
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
```



**Example 3:** 

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as **good** .
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range`[1, 10^5]`.
- Each node's value is between `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

## Approach

- There are 2 types of province: 1). A set of connected city forms a province; 2). An isolated city forms a province. 
- Idea: when isConnected[i] [j] = 1, discover connected cities from i and j, until no new city to discover, add count + 1, use an array to store visited cities.
- Thoughts of simplifications :
  -  Because the matrix is symmetrical, isConnected [i] [j] = isConnected [j] [i], only need to visit half of the matrix: iterate from row [0 , n], column [0, current row].
  - To discover new cities from i, iterate either row [i] or column [i] : isConnected[i] [0 - n] or isConnected[0 - n] [i]. 

- Option 1: visite matrix to find all 1 values.  After visiting all connected cities, add up all isolated city.
- Option 2: For all city, if it's not visited yet, then visit and find its connected city, and update count. Isolated cities are also visited during iteration.
- The 2 options use same idea of DFS, just different ways of iterating.

## Solution

```java
// Opt 1: Iterate matrix to find all isConnected = 1 
public int findCircleNum(int[][] isConnected) {
      int n = isConnected.length;
      boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
      int count = 0;
      // visit matrix, do dfs if has 1, and mark visited
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // only visit half of the matrix, the other is the same
          for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
              if (isConnected[i][j] == 1 && !visited[i] && !visited[j]) {
                // dfs will visit j in recursion
                // result would be same visiting i or j first
                  dfs(isConnected, visited, i);
                  count++;
              }
          }
      }
      // add up all non-visited city, they form a province itself
      for (boolean visit : visited) {
          count += visit ? 0 : 1;
      }
      return count;
}

 private void dfs(int[][] isConnected, boolean[] visited, int curr) {
      visited[curr] = true;
      for (int i = 0; i < isConnected.length; i++) {
          if (isConnected[i][curr] == 1 && !visited[i])
              dfs(isConnected, visited, i);
      }
}

// Opt2: iterate from city
public int findCircleNum(int[][] isConnected) {
    int n = isConnected.length;
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            dfs(isConnected, visited, i);
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O( n^2 ), visit the matrix once
- Space complexity: O (n)
