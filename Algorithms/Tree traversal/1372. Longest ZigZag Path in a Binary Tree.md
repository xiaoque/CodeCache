# [1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/description/)

You are given the `root` of a binary tree.

A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:

- Choose **any ** node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
- If the current direction is right, move to the right child of the current node; otherwise, move to the left child.
- Change the direction from right to left or from left to right.
- Repeat the second and third steps until you can't move in the tree.

Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).

Return the longest **ZigZag**  path contained in that tree.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/22/sample_1_1702.png" style="width: 221px; height: 383px;">

```
Input: root = [1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).
```

**Example 2:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/22/sample_2_1702.png" style="width: 157px; height: 329px;">

```
Input: root = [1,1,1,null,1,null,null,1,1,null,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (left -> right -> left -> right).
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`



## Approach

- For any node in the tree, either it follows previous direction (previous length + 1) or it starts a new path with different direction. Since we can not iterate node bottom-up, compute the length recursively.
- Args passed to func: current node, direction(left or right), current length. And a global var to store max value.

## Solution

```java
  public int max = 0;
  public int longestZigZag(TreeNode root) {
    	// for the first traversal, it doesn't matter if it's left or right
    	// the first call will always be dfs(root.left, 1, false), dfs(root.right, 1, true)
      dfs(root, 0, true);
      return max;
  }

  private void dfs(TreeNode root, int length, boolean isThisLeft){
      // end condition
      if(root == null)
          return ;
      // compare current length with max
      max = Math.max(length, max);

      // continue traversal
      if(isThisLeft){
          // follow the direction
          dfs(root.left, length + 1, false);
          // start a new path
        	//there is a hidden path root -> root.right, so the initial length is 1
          dfs(root.right, 1, true);
      }else{
          // same for direction right
          dfs(root.right, length + 1, true);
          dfs(root.left, 1, false);
      }
  }
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O (n), every node is visited once.
- Space complexity: O (h) where h is the height of the tree, because each recursive call uses a O(1) space.
