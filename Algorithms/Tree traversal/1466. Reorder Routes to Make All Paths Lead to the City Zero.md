# [1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

Given a binary tree `root`, a node X in the tree is named **good**  if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of **good**  nodes in the binary tree.

**Example 1:** 

**<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_1.png" style="width: 263px; height: 156px;">** 

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are **good** .
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
```
**Example 2:** 

**<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_2.png" style="width: 157px; height: 161px;">** 

```Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as **good** .
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range`[1, 10^5]`.
- Each node's value is between `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

## Approach

- Brute-force: convert input into n * n matrix, and using dfs to find path to all nodes, O(n^2) and will have memory limit exceeded for test cases.

- Simplified into adjacency lists, where list[i] is a list of cities i can go.

  > It's **guaranteed** that each city can reach city `0` after reorder

  Meaning that all nodes have a path to 0 if we ignore directions, so the number of reordering is acturally the count of paths with wrong directions. Start from city 0, the correct direction should be [i] [0] (in-edges). 

- Using dfs to traverse the graph, count the number of path with wrong directions will be the result.

## Solution

```java
public int minReorder(int n, int[][] connections) {
    // create the adjacency list
    List<List<Integer>> list = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        list.add(new ArrayList<>());
    }
  	// for in-edges, change it into negative number (correct direction)
  	// for out-edges, put the positive number (wrong direction)
    for (int[] path : connections) {
        list.get(path[0]).add(path[1]);
        list.get(path[1]).add(-path[0]);
    }

    // traverse the graph from 0 until end node, if out-edge, count ++
    return dfs(list, 0, new boolean[n]);
}

public int dfs(List<List<Integer>> list, int current, boolean[] visited) {
    // return current nodes's count + dfs(its neighbours)
    int count = 0;
    visited[current] = true;
    for (Integer city : list.get(current)) {
      	// avoid re-visiting and re-counting cities
        if (!visited[Math.abs(city)])
            count += dfs(list, Math.abs(city), visited) + (city > 0 ? 1 : 0);
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(n), construction the adjacency list takes O(n), dfs takes O(n) also.
- Space complexity: O(n)
