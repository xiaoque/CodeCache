# [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/)

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the **minimum window substring** of `s` such that every character in `t` (**including duplicates** ) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique** .

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

**Constraints:** 

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:**  Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

## Approach

- A substring => a window that contains all chars in `t`, use Hashmap to count freqency of chars.
- Steps to find a window
  - Begins with left = 0, find an index as right that contains all chars in String `t` => need a counter for all dinstinct chars. 
  - Move left forward if the left most char is redundent in substring [left, right] => its frequency is greater than needed. 
  - Compare this result with previous result, if it's smaller, store current left index and size
  - Move left forward to find next window
## Solution

```java
public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
    // get freq of chars in t
    Map<Character, Integer> freq = t.chars()
            .mapToObj(val -> (char) val)
            .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
                    x -> x,
                    Collectors.summingInt(x -> 1)));

    int count = freq.size();
    int left = 0, right = 0, start = 0, result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    // expand right index until it contains all chars in t
    while (right < s.length()) {
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        // reduce count when the char reach 0
        freq.put(c, freq.getOrDefault(c, 0) - 1);
        if (freq.get(c) == 0)
            count--;

        // move left while count = 0
        if (count == 0) {
            c = s.charAt(left);
            while (freq.get(c) < 0) {
                freq.put(c, freq.get(c) + 1);
                left++;
                c = s.charAt(left);
            }
            // check if current size is minimal
            if (result > right - left + 1) {
                result = right - left + 1;
                start = left;
            }

            // move left to find next window
            freq.put(c, freq.get(c) + 1);
            left++;
            count++;
        }
        right++;
    }

    return (result != Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? s.substring(start, start + result) : "";
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(m + n), O(n) to create the frequency map for `t`, O (m) to iterate chars in `s`.
- Space complexity: O(n) need a map to store the frequency of chars in `t`, other variables use a constant space O(1).

## Reflections

* Remember to move left forward to find next window. Otherwise, the function will always return the first window.
