# [72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/description/)

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

**Constraints:** 

- `0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Approach

- dp[i] [j] = moves at index i of word1, index j at word2

  - If word1[i] == word2[j], no move, dp[i] [j] = dp[i - 1] [j - 1]
  - Otherwise
    - insert a char in word1, same as compare word1[i] to word2[j - 1], dp[i] [j] = dp[i] [j - 1] + 1
    - delete a char in word1, dp[i] [j] = dp[i - 1] [j] + 1
    - replace a char, dp[i] [j] = dp[i] [j] + 1

- Initial cases, dp[i] [0], to compare word1 of length i with null, need to delete all chars in word1, thus dp[i] [0] = i, same for dp[0] [j] = j

  
## Solution

```java
public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
    int length1 = word1.length();
    int length2 = word2.length();
    int[][] dp = new int[length1 + 1][length2 + 1];
    // initial value
    for (int i = 1; i <= length1; i++)
        dp[i][0] = i;
    for (int i = 1; i <= length2; i++)
        dp[0][i] = i;

    // compute array
    for (int i = 1; i <= length1; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= length2; j++) {
            if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]), dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[length1][length2];
}
```
