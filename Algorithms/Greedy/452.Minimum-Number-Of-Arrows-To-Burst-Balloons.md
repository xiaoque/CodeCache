# [452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [x<sub>start</sub>, x<sub>end</sub>]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter**  stretches between `x<sub>start</sub>` and `x<sub>end</sub>`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically**  (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `x<sub>start</sub>` and `x<sub>end</sub>` is **burst**  by an arrow shot at `x` if `x<sub>start</sub> <= x <= x<sub>end</sub>`. There is **no limit**  to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return the **minimum**  number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= points.length <= 10^5`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-2^31 <= x<sub>start</sub> < x<sub>end</sub> <= 2^31 - 1`

## Approach

Problem with intervals => sort by start or sort by end, to get a minimum number of arrows, the shot should be as right as possible for each point.

* Sort by start node, the right most position will be the min end of 2 points, For a new point:
  * If its start value <= previous min end, then updates with a new min end value
  * Otherwise, shot a new arrow with its end value.
* Sort by end node, the right most position is already maintained in the sorted array. For a new point:
  * If its start value  <= previous end value, then it can reuse previous arrow
  * Otherwise, shot a new arrow with its end vlaue.
* **Note** : In edges cases where start or end values are `Integer.MAX_VALUE` or `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, to sort the array correctly use `Integer.compare(val1, val2)` instead of simple `val1 - val2` .

## Solution

```java
 // sort the points by start node
public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
    Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    // iterate points, update a range[max start, min end]
    int end = points[0][1], count = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
        // if next node start is in side the range, update range and continue
        if (points[i][0] <= end) {
            end = Math.min(points[i][1], end);
        } else {
            // otherwise, add count and update range
            count++;
            end = points[i][1];
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// sort the points by end node
public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
    Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));
    // iterate points
    int end = points[0][1], count = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
        // if next node start before end, then continue
        if (points[i][0] > end) {
            // otherwise, add count and update end
            count++;
            end = points[i][1];
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
