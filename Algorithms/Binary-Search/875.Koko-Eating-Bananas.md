# [875. Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/description/)

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `i^th` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer `k` such that she can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
- `piles.length <= h <= 10^9`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`

## Approach

- Brute-force way: order the array, iterate from 1, compute until total hour is <= h. Worst case [1, array.max()].

- Improvement: use binary search to reduce compute times.

- Binary search pattern

  ```java
  // opt1
  while(left <= right){
    mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if(arr[mid] == x) return mid;
    if(arr[mid] > x) right = mid - 1;
    left = mid + 1;
  }
  
  // opt2: condition in while changed, then right value changes also
  while(left < right){
    mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if(arr[mid] > x) right = mid;
    left = mid + 1;
  }
  ```

  
## Solution

```java
# Solution
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        // order arrays
        Arrays.sort(piles);
        // use binary search to find min rate
        int left = 1, right = piles[piles.length - 1];
        while(left < right){
            int mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            if(getTotalHour(piles, mid, h)){
                right = mid;
            }else
                left = mid + 1;
        }
        return left;
    }

    // func to compute total hour for a given rate
		// in constraints: h <= 10^9
		// avoid total > Integer.MAX_VALUE, pass h to func return boolean instead
    private boolean getTotalHour(int[] piles, int rate, int h){
        int total = 0 ;
        for(int pile : piles){
            total += (pile + rate - 1) / rate;
            if(total > h)
                return false;
        }
        return total <= h;
    }
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(nlogm), O(logm) find result from [1, m] where m is the max value in array, for each number found O(n) to compute total hour.
- Space complexity: O(1)
