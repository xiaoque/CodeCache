# [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=oizxjoit)

Suppose an array of length <code>n</code> sorted in ascending order is **rotated**  between <code>1</code> and <code>n</code> times. For example, the array <code>nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]</code> might become:

- <code>[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]</code> if it was rotated <code>4</code> times.
- <code>[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]</code> if it was rotated <code>7</code> times.

Notice that **rotating**  an array <code>[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]</code> 1 time results in the array <code>[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]</code>.

Given the sorted rotated array <code>nums</code> of **unique**  elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in<code>O(log n) time</code>.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>n == nums.length</code>
- <code>1 <= n <= 5000</code>
- <code>-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000</code>
- All the integers of <code>nums</code> are **unique** .
- <code>nums</code> is sorted and rotated between <code>1</code> and <code>n</code> times.

## Approach

* Find an index i in a sorted array => binary search.
  * Target index `nums[i] < nums[i + 1] && nums[i] < nums[i - 1]`
  * Subarray on the left of `i`  and the subarray on the right of `i` are both sorted array, **min value from left subarray is greater than max value from the right subarray**.
    * When mid value is smaller than right => mid is currently in the right subarray, move right border to mid.
    * Else move left border to mid.

## Solution

```java
public int findMin(int[] nums) {
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int m = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (nums[m] <= nums[right]) {
            right = m;
        } else {
            left = m + 1;
        }
    }
    return nums[left];
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(logn)
- Space complexity: O(1)
