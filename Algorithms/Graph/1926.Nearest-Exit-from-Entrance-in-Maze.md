# [1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze](https://leetcode.com/problems/nearest-exit-from-entrance-in-maze)

You are given an `m x n` matrix `maze` (**0-indexed** ) with empty cells (represented as `'.'`) and walls (represented as `'+'`). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where `entrance = [entrance_row, entrance_col]` denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell **up** , **down** , **left** , or **right** . You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the **nearest exit**  from the `entrance`. An **exit**  is defined as an **empty cell**  that is at the **border**  of the `maze`. The `entrance` **does not count**  as an exit.

Return the **number of steps**  in the shortest path from the `entrance` to the nearest exit, or `-1` if no such path exists.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearest1-grid.jpg" style="width: 333px; height: 253px;">

```
Input: maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.
```

**Example 2:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearesr2-grid.jpg" style="width: 253px; height: 253px;">

```
Input: maze = [["+","+","+"],[".",".","."],["+","+","+"]], entrance = [1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].
[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.
Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.
```

**Example 3:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearest3-grid.jpg" style="width: 173px; height: 93px;">

```
Input: maze = [[".","+"]], entrance = [0,0]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no exits in this maze.
```

**Constraints:** 

- `maze.length == m`
- `maze[i].length == n`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `maze[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'+'`.
- `entrance.length == 2`
- `0 <= entrance<sub>row</sub> < m`
- `0 <= entrance<sub>col</sub> < n`
- `entrance` will always be an empty cell.

## Approach

- Given a starting point, visite the graph in 4 directions.
  - Finding shortest path => using BFS
  - The starting point does not form an exit => either using a visited array or modify value directly in grid.
## Solution

```java
public static int[][] directions = { { -1, 0 }, { 1, 0 }, { 0, -1 }, { 0, 1 } };

public int nearestExit(char[][] maze, int[] entrance) {
    int level = 0;
    int m = maze.length;
    int n = maze[0].length;
    // start from level 0, mark entrance as visited
    maze[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = '+';
    // bfs, use queue to store next node
    Deque<int[]> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
  	queue.addLast(entrance);
    
  	int x = 0, y = 0;
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        // get the size of current level, visit all nodes, level ++
        int size = queue.size();
        level++;
        while (size > 0) {
            int[] current = queue.removeFirst();
            // visite node by iterating 4 directions
            for(int[] move : directions){
                x = current[0] + move[0];
                y = current[1] + move[1];
                //check if out of range or wall
                if(x < 0 || y < 0 || x == m || y == n)
                    continue;
                if(maze[x][y] == '+')
                    continue;
                // if a direction has exist 
                if(x == 0 || y == 0 || x == m - 1 || y == n - 1)
                    return level;
                // continue visiting, mark it as visited
                queue.addLast(new int[] {x, y});
                maze[x][y] = '+';
            }
            size --;
        }
    }
    // return -1 if no such path exists
    return -1;
}

```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(M*N), every node will be visited at most once.
- Space complexity: O(M*N), at worst case the queue might hold M * N nodes.
