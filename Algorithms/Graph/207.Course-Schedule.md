# [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=xi4ci4ig)

There are a total of <code>numCourses</code> courses you have to take, labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>numCourses - 1</code>. You are given an array <code>prerequisites</code> where <code>prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that you **must**  take course <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> first if you want to take course <code>a<sub>i</sub></code>.

- For example, the pair <code>[0, 1]</code>, indicates that to take course <code>0</code> you have to first take course <code>1</code>.

Return <code>true</code> if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return <code>false</code>.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>1 <= numCourses <= 2000</code>
- <code>0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000</code>
- <code>prerequisites[i].length == 2</code>
- <code>0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < numCourses</code>
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique** .

## Approach

[a, b] in prerequisites array can be seen as an edge b -> a, in example `[[1,0],[0,1]]`  can not be finished, because there is a loop between 1 and 0. The real problem is to detect whether there is a cycle in a DAG. To solve this, we can use Topological sort.

Steps:

1. Build a graph from `prerequisites` array, using an array of list.
2. Count in-edges for each node.
3. Traverse the graph only from nodes without in-edge, and remove its out-edges from the graph.
4. Repeat until there is no node to traverse.
5. If all in-edges are now removed then there is no cycle in the graph.

Step 1 and step 2 can be done in same loop.

## Solution

```java
public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
    List<Integer>[] graph = new List[numCourses];
    int[] inEdgeCount = new int[numCourses];

    // construct graph and counts in-edges
    for (int[] edge : prerequisites) {
        if (graph[edge[1]] == null)
            graph[edge[1]] = new ArrayList<>();
        graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        inEdgeCount[edge[0]]++;
    }

    // iterate from nodes with 0 in-edge
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
        if (inEdgeCount[i] == 0)
            queue.add(i);
    }
		
  	// count visted nodes
    int count = 0;
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int current = queue.poll();
        count ++;

        if (graph[current] != null) {
            for (int node : graph[current]) {
                inEdgeCount[node]--;
                if (inEdgeCount[node] == 0) {
                    queue.add(node);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return count == numCourses;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(N + E), N is node number and E is edge number. O(E) used for build graph, O(N) used for traversal.
- Space complexity: O(N + E) for the array stores graph.
