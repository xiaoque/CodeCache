# [236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor" target="_blank">definition of LCA on Wikipedia</a>: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow <b>a node to be a descendant of itself</b>).”

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png" style="width: 200px; height: 190px;">

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png" style="width: 200px; height: 190px;">

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are **unique** .
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

## Approach

- 2 cases for node p and q:
  - p, q are in different branches of the tree
  - p and q are from same branches, and one node is another's ancestor.
- A brute-force way is to build a child-parent map and node level, then find lowest level common parent (or node itself).
- Improved way is to travesal tree using DFS, stop traversal when encountering p or q or leaf node. Recursively visit left and right branch. For a node
  - If either left or right is null, that means one node is not in the branch (stops for the end condition root == null), then return current node.
  - If both left and right are not null, the current node is the LCA for p and q.
## Solution

```java
  public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
      // end condition for the traversal
      if(root == null || root == p || root == q)
          return root;

      // traverse left and right nodes
      TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
      TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

      // case when p and q are descendant of current node
      if(left != null && right != null)
          return root;

      // null means node p, q not found in left branch
      if(left == null)
          return right;
      return left;


  }
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(n), every node is visited once
- Space complexity: O(n)
