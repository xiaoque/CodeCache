# [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner**  (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner**  (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10^9`.

**Example 1:** 
<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png" style="width: 400px; height: 183px;">

```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= m, n <= 100`

## Approach

* The robot can only move down or right means for any position [i] [j], robot either comes from [i - 1] [j] or [i] [j - 1].
* Using a 2d-array, where dp[i] [j] means number of ways to reach to position[i] [j], it's clear that dp[i] [j] = dp[i - 1] [j] + dp[i] [j - 1].
  * For basic cases: there is only one way for row 0 (go right at each move), same for column 0 (go down at each move) 
  * Iteration should be bottom-up

## Solution

```java
public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    int[][] memo = new int[m][n];
  	// basic cases for row 0
    Arrays.fill(memo[0], 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
      	// basic case for column 0
        memo[i][0] = 1;
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            memo[i][j] = memo[i - 1][j] + memo[i][j - 1];
        }
    }
    return memo[m - 1][n - 1];
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O (m * n)
- Space complexity:  O(m * n)

## Reflections

Since dp[i] [j] = dp[i - 1] [j] + dp[i] [j - 1], we can simplified by using 1d-array to store values in row[i - 1], and compute values for row [i] from row [i - 1].

Value mappings for dp[i] [j]: 

* dp[i] [j] => dp[j]
* dp[i] [j - 1] => dp[j - 1], because j - 1 is computed, thus its value corresponds to the value in row i.
* dp[i - 1] [j] => dp[j], we want to compute dp[j], the current value in dp[j] is still the value from previous row, which is dp[i - 1] [j].
* The equation becomes dp[j] += dp[j - 1].
* Basic cases, start from row 0 where dp[i] = 1 for any index.

```java
public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[] memo = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(memo, 1);
        for(int i = 1; i < m; i ++){
            for(int j = 1; j < n; j ++){
                memo[j] += memo[j - 1];
            }
        }
        return memo[n - 1];
}
```

In this case, we reduced the space complexity from O (m * n) to O (n). Time complexity remains unchanged.
