# [450. Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the **root node reference**  (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

- Search for a node to remove.
- If the node is found, delete the node.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del_node_1.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 214px;">

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- Each node has a **unique**  value.
- `root` is a valid binary search tree.
- `-10^5 <= key <= 10^5`

**Follow up:**  Could you solve it with time complexity `O(height of tree)`?

## Approach

- Recursion to find node with value `key`, if key > root.val, search node in right subtree, otherwise, search in left subtree.
- 3 situations for the node `curr` 
  - The value doesnt exist, return root
  - `curr` has 1 child node, then remove `curr` and replace it with child node
  - `curr` has 2 children nodes, because it's a **BST**, assume `left` be the left-most child node in the subtree `curr.right`, then we certainly have `left.val > curr.left.val`. To remove `curr` while maintain **BST**, move subtree `curr.left` as the left child of `left`, replace curr with `curr.right`.  
## Solution

```java
public TreeNode deleteNode(TreeNode root, int key) {

  if(root == null)
        return root;

  // found the key
  if(root.val == key){
      if(root.left == null)
          return root.right;
      else if (root.right == null)
          return root.left;
      else {
          TreeNode right = root.right;
          while(right.left != null)
              right = right.left;
          // place left subtree under right node
          right.left = root.left;
          root = root.right;
          return root;
      }
  }

  // call recursion
  if(root.val > key) root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
  if(root.val < key) root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);

  return root;
}

```
