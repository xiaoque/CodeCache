# [124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=oizxjoit)

A **path**  in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once** . Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum**  of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, return the maximum **path sum**  of any **non-empty**  path.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx1.jpg" style="width: 322px; height: 182px;">

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg">

```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 3 * 10^4]</code>.
- <code>-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000</code>

## Approach

- By definition of path that `each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them`. In the path, **there will be at most 1 node that its left and right child are also in the path and the node should be at the beginning of the path**.
- For a given node `curr`, the final path either contains its 2 children `result = curr.val + curr.left + curr.right`, or only one of its child `sum = max(dp(curr.left), dp(curr.right)) + curr.val` (in this case, we need to return this value for its ancestor node).
  - Using DFS to visite the tree from root node to leaf node, return `sum` in recursion.
  - For each node, compare its `result` to get a global max result. To make sure `result` is the current max value, only add positive values.
## Solution

```java
int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
    dfs(root);
    return max;
}

public int dfs(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null)
        return 0;

    int left = Math.max(0, dfs(node.left));
    int right = Math.max(0, dfs(node.right));

    max = Math.max(max, left + right + node.val);

    return Math.max(left, right) + node.val;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(N), each node is visited once.
- Space complexity: O(N) for the recursion.

## Reflections

It's easy to relate max path sum to DFS, but not that obviously which value to return.
